## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to <font color="#3778AE">6.S096</font>!

While we may not see it, the vast field of number theory is all around us. From the cryptosystems that enable secure communications to applications in scheduling, number theory is a vast area of mathematics which we're passionate about, and we'd like to share that passion with you. 


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- master the basics of modular arithmetic,
- express the elementary results of modular arithmetic in the language of groups,
- use the language of group theory with comfort.


## PREREQUISITES
- **Number Theory**: No previous experience required, but modular aithmetic strongly encouraged. 
- **Proof Writing**: Strong grasp of Proofs by induction, contradiction, etc... Similar to <font color="#31493C"><b>18.062/6.1200 (6.042)6</b></font> and <font color="#31493C"><b>18.090</b></font>. 
- **Programming**: knowledge of a programming language (esp. Python) recommended but not required.
## SOFTWARE
You will be doing some light programming using (a) **Python** and/or (b) **Sage** to implement. We do not expect you to know Sage, but we do expect some familiarity with Python. If you are not already familiar with Python, you will be expected to learn a bit on your own. 

## COURSE STRUCTURE
The main delivery of information will be via **Lectures** and **Problem Sets**. In lecture, we will cover important foundations and some results, which will be cemented and complemented through **Problem Sets**. There will be additional readings and/or pre-recorded lectures before the course begins so everyone is up to date on the same content. 

### Problem Sessions


Starting January 15: 
We will operate an inverted model for a week, with assigned reading materials released, and then three two-hour problem solving sessions. 
- Problem Session 1 (Tuesday January 15): Modular Arithmetic
- Problem Session 2 (Wednesday January 17): Euler and Fermat's Theorems
- Problem Session 3 (Thursday January 18): More Elementary Number Theory

### Lectures

Starting January 22: 
We will have lectures on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in building 34.303 from 10:30am to 12pm. We will take a short break in the middle.  

- Lecture 1: Quadratic Residues, Primitive Roots
- Lecture 2: Group Theory; with a focus on the previous content 
- Lecture 3: Introduction to Cryptography (and some Elliptic Curves)
- Lecture 4: Fourier Analysis on Finite Abelian Groups (Signal Processing)
- Lecture 5: Integers, Prime Numbers, and More. 
- Lecture 6: Wrap Up: Bonus Results in Theoretical Computer Science. 

## GRADING
There are two possible grading schemes, and whichever yields a maximum output will be used. The passing grade in the class will be 60%. 

### <font color="#5B90E0">HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS (70%)</font>
There will be approximately four homework assignments, equally weighed. These will count for at least 70% of your grade. 

### <font color="#5B90E0">SCRIBING (30%)</font>
Each registered student will have the option to write a small 2 page 'expository note' (which may be build slightly on lecture notes) counting up to 30% of their grade. 

## RESOURCES
**To be completed.**
- [Emergency Helpline](mailto:6.s096-iap24-staff@mit.edu): for private concerns, issues, and questions (not course-content related).  
- [Supplemental Resources](supplemental): a compilation of useful, external resources

## HELP
Students are encouraged to consistently read lecture notes and actively participate in discussions (**Piazza**) This is intended to be a shared learning environment for all students in the class. 

Teaching Staff will hold scheduled **Office Hours** throughout every week. They will be a fun, interactive time to ask questions.
