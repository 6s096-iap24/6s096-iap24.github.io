## OVERVIEW
Welcome to 6.S096! We are really excited to have you in class this IAP. 


### DESCRIPTION
Many applications in cryptography and theoretical computer science rely on number theory, which is often not taught in introductory classes. In this class, we try to teach these concepts. We begin with a quick review of the basics: Euclidean algorithm and modular arithmetic. We will then cover multiplicative modular arithmetic (Euler, Fermat), elements of group theory, the discrete logarithm problem, and elementary analytic number theory if time permits. There will be a slight focus on computational methods as well, using Sage and other Computer Algebra Systems.

The assessments will consist of weekly homeworks with a small, optional final project. The expectation is that students have taken 6.042/6.1200 or a class at a similar level in discrete mathematics, as well as some coding experience.

## LOGISTICS
### LECTURE
- Starting from Monday, January 22: Lectures Tuesday through Thursday @ 10:30am - 12pm in 34.303 (may change locations, depending on enrollment)
- Lectures are in-person and over Zoom, but will *not* be recorded, although lecture notes will be released.
- Attendance and active participation is *highly encouraged* to facilitate an enriching learning environment for everyone

### OFFICE HOURS
- Will be updated soon. 


### GRADING
- 100% psets or 70% psets and 30% a mini-expository paper abut a topic you learned (graded on completion) - whichever is best for the student.
- The cutoff for passing is 60%.

## QUICK ACCESS

- [Project Ideas (coming soon)](): on-going spreadsheet to collaboratively find and create research projects
- [Contacting Instructors](mailto:6s096-iap24@mit.edu): for concerns, issues, and questions (not course content). Note that there is *no* period in 6s096 in the email address.

## ENROLLMENT
Please pre-register! The class is offered as a U/G class and will be graded on a P/F basis. 

### PREREQUISITES 
For 6.S096, you need experience and skill with mathematical concepts, theorems, and proofs.  If you did well in 18.062/6.042, 18.200, 18.090, or any proof-oriented mathematics class, you should be fine! Some exposure to elementary number theory (modular arithmetic) and programming (e.g. Python) is also strongly recommended but not required. We  _based these on 18.404's recommended background_

### COURSE NAME
Disclaimer: The course title "Number Theory â€“ All You Need to Know" is intended for promotional purposes. While the class covers a wide range of topics in the field, its main goal is to spark your interest and curiosity in the subject.
